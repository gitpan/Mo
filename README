NAME
    Mo - Micro Objects. Mo is less.

SYNOPSIS
        package Less;
        use Mo;
        extends 'Nothing';

        has 'something' => ( is => 'rw' );

        sub BUILD {
            my $self = shift;
            $self->SUPER::BUILD();
            # ... 
        }

DESCRIPTION
    use Mo. Mo is less.

    Moose led to Mouse led to Moo led to Mo. M is nothing. Mo is more. Not
    much.

    When Moo is more than you need, drop an 'o' and get some Mo.

FEATURES
    This is what you get. Nothing Mo.

    "new" method
        Mo provides a "new" object constructor. It will call the "BUILD"
        method after creation if it "can".

    "extends"
        Mo exports the "extends" keyword, to name your parent class. "Mo"
        itself is your default parent class, of course.

    "has"
        Mo exports a "has" keyword, to generate accessors.

        These accessors support "get" and "set" operations. That's it.

        Any extra arguments after the name, are silently ignored.

            has 'name';
            has 'same' => ( is => 'ro' );

        This lets you switch from Moo to Mo and back, without having to
        change all your accessors.

    "strict" and "warnings"
        Mo turns on "use strict" and "use warnings".

    Embeddable
        Mo is tiny. You can easily inline it in your code, if you want to.
