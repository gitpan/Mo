NAME
    Mo - Micro Objects. Mo is less.

SYNOPSIS
        package Less;
        use Mo;
        extends 'Nothing';

        has 'something' => (
            is => 'rw',
            default => sub {
                my $self = shift;
                $self->build_something;
            },
        );

        sub BUILD {
            my $self = shift;
            $self->SUPER::BUILD();
            # ... 
        }

DESCRIPTION
    use Mo. Mo is less. Much less.

    Moose led to Mouse led to Moo led to Mo. M is nothing. Mo is more. Not
    much.

    When Moo is more than you need, drop an 'o' and get some Mo.

FEATURES
    This is what you get. Nothing Mo.

    "new" method
        Mo provides a "new" object constructor. It will call the "BUILD"
        method after creation if it "can".

        NOTE: Unlike other Moose modules, BUILD is not called in a chained
        fashion. You would need to call "SUPER::BUILD" yourself, if you
        needed that.

    "extends"
        Mo exports the "extends" keyword, to name your parent class. "Mo"
        itself is your default parent class, of course.

    "has"
        Mo exports a "has" keyword, to generate accessors.

        These accessors support "get" and "set" operations and allows a
        "default". That's it.

            has 'name';
            has 'name' => ( default => sub { 'Joe' } );

        "has" takes arguments after the name. Here is what it currently
        supports:

        default
            Must be a code reference. The object instance is passed in, and
            it should return the default value for this attribute. "default"
            is always called lazily. ie It is called when you try to get the
            value and it does not(exists()).

        builder
            Must be a method name. This method should return the default
            value for this attribute. "builder" is always called lazily.

        Any other arguments are ignored. This lets you switch from Moo to Mo
        and back, without having to change all your accessors.

    "strict" and "warnings"
        Mo turns on "use strict" and "use warnings" for you.

    Embeddable
        Mo is tiny. It is currently 10 lines, <= 80 chars.

        You could easily inline it in your code, if you wanted to.
